## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by emailing **security@example.com** or by submitting a report via our [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/security/advisories).

We aim to respond to all vulnerability reports within **5 business days**. You will receive updates on the status of your report at least once per week until the issue is resolved or closed.

After you submit a report, our security team will investigate the issue and contact you for any additional information if needed. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work with you to coordinate a fix and public disclosure. If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide a clear explanation.
